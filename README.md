# NEU 6205 - Program Structure and Algorithms

This repository serves as a digital archive for all my assignments, projects, and comprehensive work for the NEU 6205 Course on Spring 2023, covering Program Structure and Algorithms.

## Course Description

The course begins with a primer on dynamic memory allocation followed by an in-depth exploration of fundamental data structures and their associated algorithms. The focus is on understanding abstract data structures and the factors influencing implementation choices. The curriculum delves into:

- Dynamic memory and its management
- Fundamental data structures: Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Advanced constructs: Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs
- Algorithmic paradigms: Recursion, Searching, Sorting
- Data encapsulation and abstraction in software engineering
- External storage structures (time-permitting)

As an introductory journey into algorithms, the course underscores the design techniques essential for solving computational challenges. We touch upon a variety of topics including, but not limited to:

- Sorting and Search Trees
- Heaps and Hashing
- Divide-and-Conquer Strategies
- Dynamic Programming
- Amortized Analysis
- Graph Algorithms: Shortest Paths, Network Flow
- Randomized and Approximation Algorithms
- Graph Search Techniques

## Coursework

The repository includes:

- Weekly homework assignments.
- Study materials for two in-class midterm exams and one final exam.
- A research project encapsulating the application of the course principles.
